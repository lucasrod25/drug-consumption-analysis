# Predicting Drug Consumption
Overview of proj
## Models
### Gateway Drug Model
This model is meant to find out if there is a connection between marijuana, alcohol, and hard drug use. It can be found in gateway_drug_model.ipynb. There are three different models, but the one we chose to be in our UI is the third model, an SVM. There is also a grid search for this SVM towards the end of the file.

To run this model, you can run the cells in the jupyter notebook from start to finish. If there is a dependency error, there is code at the very bottom of the notebook that can be run to install an external library that was used to plot the SVM.
## How to Run
